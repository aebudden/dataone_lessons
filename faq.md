# Welcome to the DataONE Data Management Education Module Repo!

This repository contains DataONE Education Modules that have been updated and translated from PowerPoint format to a more easily updated format. Each Education Module contains a set of slides with annotations, as well as a hands on exercise and a one-page explanatory sheet that distills the main points and lessons to take away. The Education Modules are intended to be flexible and updated by a range of users and audiences. Please let us know what you think! 

## Guidelines for presenters

### Where to find the material?

A list of the lessons can be found on [the website associated][website] with this
repository. The first page will present you with a list of the available lessons, and
clicking on each lesson will launch the presentations.

### What material is included?

Each of the DataONE Education Modules is comprised of three parts: a set of slides with presenter notes, a one-page explanatory sheet, and a hands-on exercise. These materials are meant to be flexible. They are usable and adaptable for use in a range of contexts-- for personal education, in classroom settings, by librarians teaching data management workshops, and more. 

### How does this work?

The slides are provided as HTML documents that you can view and present in your browser, with or without the annotated notes. Everything should work in recent versions of the Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers. Please note that your browser needs to allow Javascript.

### Presentation mode

Every slide deck can be opened or "cloned," in Github speak by pressing `c`. This will open it in another
pop-up window. Your browser may prompt you to allow or reject this pop-up window. Presentation mode can be activated by pressing 'p' on the slides page. This mode should open the "presentation view" on your screen, and the viewer mode on the screen for your audience. You can also press `f` for fullscreen.

You can change slides by pressing the left and right arrows, or by swiping left
or right on a touch-enabled device.
