How to Create and Edit a Tutorial.

This tutorial describes how to edit existing and create new tutorials in this DataONE Lessons site.

[DataONE Lessons](/dataone_lessons/) are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown) and converted to HTML presentations using [remark](https://remarkjs.com/#1) and PDF using [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape). The site is constructed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) where the [full source ](https://github.com/DataONEorg/dataone_lessons) is available.
