What is metadata?  Metadata is data (or documentation) that describes and provides context for data and it is everywhere around us.  Metadata allows us to understand the details of a dataset, including: where it was collected, how it was collected, what gaps in the data mean, what the units of measurement are, who collected the data, how it should be attributed etc. By creating and providing good descriptive metadata for our own data, we enable others to efficiently discover and use the data products from our research.  This lesson explores the importance of metadata to data authors, users of the data and organizations, and highlights the utility of metadata. It provides an overview of the different metadata standards that exist, and the core elements that are consistent across them. It guides users in selecting a metadata standard to work with and introduces the best practices needed for writing a high quality metadata record.
