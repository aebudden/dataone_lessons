# The Data Life Cycle

.center[![The DataONE Data Life Cycle](images/slide4.png)]

???

The Data Life Cycle is a continuum of data development, manipulation, management, and storage stages. Data citation is part of the "Describe" phase of the Life Cycle, though it is also related to Preservation and Discovery.

---

# Definitions

Data Citation
* The practice of providing a reference to data in the same way as researchers routinely provide a bibliographic reference to printed resources.
* A key practice underpinning the recognition of data as a primary research output rather than as a by-product of research

---

# Definitions

Data Author
* Individual involved in research, education, or other activities that generate digital data that are subsequently deposited in a data collection

# Definitions

Persistent Identifier
* A unique web-compatible alphanumeric code that points to a resource (e.g., data set) that will be preserved for the long term (i.e., over several hardware and software generations)
* Should direct to latest available version of resource or to metadata which enables acquisition of desired version or format

# Benefits of Data Citation 

## Short term
.two-third[* Facilitates discovery of relationships between data and publications, making it easier to validate and build upon previous work
* Ensures that proper credit can be given when others use your work
* Facilitates impact assessments of datasets based on number of publications that cite them
* Helps researchers re-using data to find other ways the data has been used]

# Benefits of Data Citation

## Long term
.two-third[* Promotes the availability of data into the future
* Facilitates discovery of  existing data relevant to a particular question
* Enables recognition of scholarly effort within disciplines and organizations 
* Increases transparency of scientific research]

???

Adoption of practices that rely on publishing infrastructure help to ensure data will be available in the future --- is this really true? I reworded it, but just thinking about it…nothing is guaranteed…?
Prevents ‘data stealing’ because rules of publication apply to citable data in that it must be cited or treated as plagiarism….
Easier to discover existing data relevant to a particular question

# Principles of Data Citation

.two-third[* **Importance** - Data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research
* **Credit and Attribution** - Data citations should facilitate giving scholarly credit and normative and legal attribution to all contributors to the data
* **Evidence** - In scholarly literature, whenever and wherever a claim relies upon data, the corresponding data should be cited
* **Unique Identification** - A data citation should include a persistent method for identification that is machine actionable, globally unique, and widely used by a community]

---

# Principles of Data Citation, continued

.two-third[* **Access** - Data citations should facilitate access to the data, metadata, code, and other materials, as necessary for both humans and machines
* **Persistence** - Unique identifiers, data, and metadata should persist beyond the lifespan of the data they describe
* **Specificity and Verifiability** - Data citations should facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim
* **Interoperability and Flexibility** - Data citation methods should be flexible, but enable interoperability across communities]

# How to Cite Data

.two-third[
* Similar to citing a published article or book
 * Provide information necessary to identify and locate the work cited
* Broadly-applicable data citation standards have not yet been established; use standards adopted by relevant academic journal, data repository, or professional organization
* In "Achieving human and machine accessibility of cited data in scholarly publications" Starr et al. (2015) set out implementation guidelines across disciplines
* doi: [10.7717/peerj-cs.1](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1)]

# Examples of Data Citation Formats, continued

* **Research Data Alliance (RDA)**:
 * The RDA Working Group on Data Citation (WG-DC) aims to bring together a group of experts to discuss the issues, requirements, advantages and shortcomings of existing approaches for efficiently citing subsets of data.
 * Final recommendations of the WG-DC were published in “Data Citation of Evolving Data” in 20152.
 * **Recommended citation elements:** persistent query identification and storage on versioned data; based on timestamping, a specific subset can be retrieved by re-executing the query. 
 * ** Example citation:**
Stefan Proell (2015) “Austria Facts” created at 2015-10-07 10:51:55:0, PID[ark:12345/qmZi2wO2vv]. Subset of CIA: “The CIA World Factbook”, PID[ark:12345/cLfH9FjxnA].

# What are examples of Persistent Identifiers?

A **persistent identifier** should be included in the citation:
* DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
 * Globally unique, alphanumeric string assigned by a registration agency to identify content and provide a persistent link to its location. 
 * May be assigned to any item of intellectual property that is defined by structured metadata
 * Examples:10.1234/NP5678, 10.5678/ISBN-0-7645-4889-4; 10.2224/2004-10-ISO-DOI
* ARK (Archival Resource Key)
 * URL designed to support long-term access to information objects
 * Can refer to digital, physical, or intangible objects or living beings and groups
 * Example: http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k
 

???

DOIs always start with 10.

# What are examples of Persistent Identifiers?, continued

More persistent identifiers:
* UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
 * 'practically unique' identifiers that can be generated by distributed systems but later combined into a single database without needing to resolve identifier (ID) conflicts
 * 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters
 * Example: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
* Researcher identifier: ORCID (Open Researcher & Contributor ID)
 * Central registry of unique identifiers for individual researchers to address author name ambiguity
 * Transparent linking mechanism between ORCID and other author ID schemes

# Best Practices to Support Data Citation

To support access to your data:
* Use application that supports metadata creation for environmental data sets
    * Morpho
    * Metavist (USDA Forest Service)
    * Mermaid (NOAA)
 * Use standardized keywords to describe your data
    * Biocomplexity Thesaurus (USGS)
    * Global Change Master Directory (NASA)
 * Use a persistent identifier such as DOI or ARK

---

# Best Practices to Support Data Citation, continued

* Work with journal publishers and data repositories to archive data during the publication process
 * Allows information about how to access your data set to be published with your article
   * Note: Data repositories typically offer to embargo archived data for a pre-determined time period after publication
 * Allows article citation/DOI to be included with archived data set
 
---
 
# Best Practices to Support Data Citation, continued 

* Encourage other data authors to cite data and to make their own data available for reuse:
 * Provide full citation information for data whenever you publish work that makes use of another author’s data
 * Archive your own data in a repository that supports data discovery and reuse
 * Update your archived data sets when newer versions are available

> *"Software citation is an evolving area. A web search for ‘how to cite software’ and its variants shows that this is a popular question. The answers can broadly be classed into citation formats recommended by journals, citation formats recommended/mandated by software providers and, most contentious, the view that software is not a citable output."*

# Citation of Scientific Software

* Why cite software?
 * Software itself may be considered to be data or a research product.
 * Findings of a study are not only based on data, but on the software used to support the analysis of the data.
 * Software citation is essential for enabling reproducibility of results.
 * Give proper attribution to the developers/authors of software.
* When should software be cited?
 * "Standard" office software (e.g. Word, Excel) and programming languages do not need formal citations. 
 * DO provide citations for specialized/custom software or programs  when their use directly impacts the results.

---

# Examples of information needed in software citations

* Similar to data citation, software citations should include:
 * Title/Name of the Software
 * Author/Developer – if known
 * Release Date/Year
 * Version Number – the version of the software/program used
 * Descriptor – the text"[computer program]" (including brackets) is often included in the citation 
 * Publisher name and location – if applicable
 * URL – if the software is available online, provide the URL
 * DOI – if one exists for the software, cite it

---
