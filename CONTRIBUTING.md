# Guidelines for contributors and content editors

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this educational material! This document provides an
introduction to the ways the lessons are organized, the tools we use to display
them, and the type of modifications we expect.

This repository was developed by the DataONE Community Engagement and Outreach Working Group and continues to be maintained by members of this team. Information about suggesting changes or adding new content may be found below. 

## Structure of the modules

Each of the educational modules is generated from markdown documents. These guidelines will walk
you through the repository organization, the markdown basics, and any additional
information.

## Repository organization

Every lesson is a single folder within the `lessons` directory. Each lesson
folder is called `XX_keyword`, where `XX` is the lesson number, and `keyword` is
a brief description of the lesson. The slides themselves are in a file called
`index.md`. Do not use another filename. For example, the [demonstration
lesson][demolessonhtml] markdown file can be [viewed here][demolessonmd]. This
demonstration lesson showcases most of the features you can use in your slides.

[demolessonhtml]: https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/lessons/00_markdown/index.html "Rendered demonstration lesson"
[demolessonmd]: https://github.com/DataONEorg/Education/blob/master/lessons/00_markdown/index.md "Raw markdown file for the demonstration lesson"

You are free to add other directories to your lesson. Images go in `images`, and
PDF files in `pdf`. For example, a lesson repository could look like:

~~~
01_management/
  index.md
  images/
    image1.png
    image3.jpg
  pdf/
    one-pager.pdf
~~~

## Informations about the tools used

The markdown documents are rendered into a website using [*Jekyll*][jekyll]. The slides
themselves are rendered using [*remarkjs*][remark]. The rendering is done using github
pages, which builds the site from the `master` branch. You can build the site
locally with `jekyll serve -w`, and it will be available at
[`http://localhost:4000`][local] for you to review.

[jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll website"
[remark]: https://remarkjs.com/#1 "RemarkJS website"
[local]: http://localhost:4000

The stylesheets are defined in `resources/styles`, and rendered to
`resources/dataone.css` using `lessc` (just type `make` from the root).
